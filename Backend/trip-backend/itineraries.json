    "result": "This itinerary is extremely challenging given the budget of ₹3222 (approximately SGD 55) for two people for two days in Singapore, including flights from India.  International flights alone would likely exceed this budget.  To make this feasible, we'll need to drastically adjust expectations. This revised itinerary focuses on maximizing free activities and minimizing costs, assuming you already have flights booked within the budget (which is highly unlikely).\n\n**Note:** This itinerary prioritizes free and low-cost nature experiences.  Food costs are minimized, and accommodation assumes you’ve found an extremely affordable option (hostel dorm or similar). Flights are assumed to be pre-arranged and not included in the ₹3222 budget.\n\n**Day 1: Gardens by the Bay & Southern Ridges**\n\n* **Morning (Free):** Start your day at Gardens by the Bay.  Focus on the free areas like the Supertree Grove (amazing for photos!), the Cloud Forest (entrance fee might be too expensive, consider skipping), and the Flower Dome (also might be too expensive). Explore the walking paths and enjoy the greenery.\n* **Lunch (₹500/SGD 8.50):**  Find affordable hawker food.  Look for places offering local dishes like chicken rice or laksa, sharing portions to save money.  Hawker centres are your best bet for budget-friendly meals.\n* **Afternoon (Free):** Hike or walk along parts of the Southern Ridges. This offers stunning views and diverse natural landscapes. Choose a shorter section to manage the time and energy.\n* **Evening (Free):** Enjoy the sunset at Mount Faber Park, accessible from the Southern Ridges.  It offers beautiful panoramic views of the city skyline.\n* **Dinner (₹500/SGD 8.50):** More affordable hawker fare. Share a meal to keep costs down.\n* **Accommodation (₹1722/SGD 30):**  A budget hostel dorm or a very basic guesthouse. This part is crucial and requires pre-booking to secure affordable options.\n\n**Day 2: Pulau Ubin & East Coast Park**\n\n* **Morning (₹500/SGD 8.50):** Take a bumboat (ferry) to Pulau Ubin, a rustic island offering a glimpse of Singapore's past.  The bumboat fare needs to be factored into the budget.  Explore the island's quieter areas on foot or rent a bicycle (costs need checking).\n* **Lunch (₹500/SGD 8.50):** Pack some snacks and drinks to avoid eating at restaurants on Pulau Ubin. \n* **Afternoon (Free):** After Pulau Ubin, head to East Coast Park. Enjoy the beaches, walking paths, and the calmer atmosphere. This is a great place for a relaxing afternoon.\n* **Evening (Free):**  Enjoy the sunset along East Coast Park.\n* **Dinner (₹500/SGD 8.50):**  Affordable hawker food near East Coast Park or pack your own picnic dinner.\n* **Return to Accommodation:** Head back to your accommodation.\n\n**Total Estimated Cost (excluding flights):** ₹3222 (approximately SGD 55)\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Flights:** The biggest hurdle is the cost of flights from India to Singapore. This budget is exceptionally tight and practically impossible if you're including flights.\n* **Accommodation:**  Finding accommodation within this budget will be challenging.  Book well in advance to secure the best deals on hostels or budget guesthouses.\n* **Transportation:**  Public transport in Singapore is efficient and affordable. Use the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) and buses.\n* **Food:**  Stick to hawker centres for incredibly affordable and delicious meals.  Packing snacks will help reduce costs.\n\nThis itinerary is designed to provide a taste of Singapore’s nature without overspending.  It is crucial to realistically assess the flight cost before planning this trip.  Consider extending the trip or increasing the budget for a more comfortable and enjoyable experience.\n",
